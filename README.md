# Mohammed Atef

I am a full-stack developer who builds web applications with a focus on maintainability, performance and system design. I deliver end-to-end solutions from frontend interfaces to backend services, and prioritize code quality and long-term stability over short-term fixes. I take ownership of problems beyond initial implementation to ensure systems are reliable, scalable, and well tested.

## Core Skills

**Languages**
- JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS

**Frontend**
- React.js, Next.js
- Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- Redux Toolkit, React Context API

**Backend**
- Node.js, Express.js
- MongoDB, Mongoose
- Prisma, Supabase

**Engineering & Tooling**
- Git, GitHub
- Jest (testing)
- CI/CD pipelines

## Engineering Approach

I focus on writing high quality code that is clean, efficient and easy to maintain. When building web applications, I think about how they will scale, how errors are handled, and how easy they are for developers to work with. Testing and documentation are part of the development process from the start, not added later.
